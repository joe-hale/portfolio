            <p>Following the method of Derek Beaulieu's <cite>Flatland</cite> (2007), <cite>Constellations</cite> is a writing-through of Tom McCarthy's novel <cite>C</cite> (2010). Under the influence of McCarthy's electric prose, each page was carefully read through and lines were drawn between nouns starting with c, a number of which are key nodes in the novel's structure. The works resulting from this procedure map the crooked path taken through the text as this network of words was pursued and visualised.</p>
