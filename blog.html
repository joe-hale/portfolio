            <h2>White Noise</h2>
            <p>Recently I finished a piece based on Don DeLillo's novel <cite>White Noise</cite>. This project started off with the idea of trying to find a textual equivalent to the image of a staticky TV that recurs in the novel and is represented on the cover of some editions of the book.</p>

<p>Along this line I recalled a text called <a href="https://www.gauss-pdf.com/post/41911267120/gpdf062-angela-genusa-tender-buttons"><cite>Tender Buttons</cite> by Angela Genusa</a> that is based on Gertrude Stein's 1914 work of the same name. Stein's prose poems in <cite>Tender Buttons</cite> respond to cubism and create a literary analogue of the distorted perspectives and abstracted objects of cubist paintings. Genusa's follow-up experiment is a distortion too, but of Stein's own text, making it even more chaotic and unreadable.</p>

<p>Here is the first line of Genusa's version:</p>

<p>Z██2Sƒ│ÅícG╪»O«ÜσÖï─#"ê*D*"üê└;.</p>

<p>Stein's language is altered beyond recognition and it appears as if some glitch or error has occurred. It was not static exactly but the noisy and unusual surface of the text intrigued me.</p>

<p>After digging around I discovered that Genusa's work was in fact a mojibake of Stein's text through this podcast <a href="https://jacket2.org/podcasts/into-the-field-angela-genusa">Into the Field: Angela Genusa</a> on Jacket2. Mojibake is a weird phenomenon that occurs when an electronic text is decoded using the wrong character encoding. The result is garbled text as characters get switched out for random symbols and characters from the Unicode map.</p>

<p>Genusa reroutes this procedure, which is normally viewed as an error and only occurs accidentally, towards artistic ends. After making this discovery I felt that mojibake was a process I could apply to my idea for a <cite>White Noise</cite> piece.</p>

<p>This is how I got started on my own mojibake experiments. I retyped pages of DeLillo's novel and used a code editor to alter the character encoding and modify the appearance of the text. In most cases the changes which occurred were very minimal – it was only when I experimented with translating DeLillo's prose into non-Latin languages using Google Translate, then altering the character encoding, that the variations were stronger and similar to Genusa's <cite>Tender Buttons</cite> in that they rendered the original text totally illegible.</p>

<p>I continued this way of working, going through different languages and character encodings to transform pages of my DeLillo copy, on and off for about a year. I reached a point where I recognised that this work was a dead end though – I couldn't see a way to create a finished piece of work using this method and lay the project to one side.</p>

<p>I got an alternative idea some time later when I was reading Neal Stephenson's novel <cite>Snow Crash</cite>. There is a plot device in Stephenson's book which involves hiding information in bitmap images, with black and white pixels representing the ones and zeroes of binary code. The image of black and white pixels reminded me of <cite>White Noise</cite> and the staticky TV. In <cite>Snow Crash</cite> the image that's displayed is still and contains a virus. My suspicion though was that if I could create multiple bitmap images, and then loop them together, I could potentially revive my DeLillo project as this would simulate a detuned TV.</p>

<p>I didn't have the know-how to do this straight away and filed the idea in the back of my mind as my attention turned to other things. Eventually I think I came across a YouTube video that showed how to create a bitmap image from binary code and everything clicked. I transformed my copy of DeLillo's text, which was 500k+ characters, into binary code, making it 8x longer – just under 4.6 MB. I then split this file up into lots of smaller files which I could visualise as bitmaps by adding a header and changing the file format. After looping the bitmaps into a sequence, the doubly encoded copy of <cite>White Noise</cite> was compressed into a 20-second long GIF reminiscent of a fuzzy TV screen. This turned out to be a neat solution to the project but I took a roundabout way to get there.</p>

            <h2>Blogging</h2>
            <p>Feels like my old Wordpress blog has run its course so am going to 
                try a very basic blog-style page on this site...will lack the functionality
                of a proper blogging platform but hopefully I'll be inclined to write more.
